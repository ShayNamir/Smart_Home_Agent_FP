## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to protect users.

### 2. Email us directly

Send an email to: `security@example.com` (replace with your actual email)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: As quickly as possible, typically within 30 days

### 4. Disclosure Process

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- Once resolved, we will coordinate public disclosure
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Considerations

### Home Assistant Integration

- **API Tokens**: Store Home Assistant tokens securely
- **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for Home Assistant connections
- **Access Control**: Limit Home Assistant API access to necessary services only
- **Token Rotation**: Regularly rotate long-lived access tokens

### AI Model Security

- **Local Execution**: Models run locally via Ollama for privacy
- **No Data Transmission**: No user data is sent to external AI services
- **Model Validation**: Verify model integrity and sources
- **Resource Limits**: Implement timeout and resource limits

### Code Security

- **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- **Logging**: No sensitive data is logged

### Development Security

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated security checks before commits
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security scanning of dependencies
- **Code Review**: All changes require code review
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing including security scenarios

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Secure Home Assistant Setup**:
   - Use strong passwords and 2FA
   - Keep Home Assistant updated
   - Use HTTPS with valid certificates
   - Restrict network access

2. **Ollama Security**:
   - Run Ollama in a secure environment
   - Use trusted model sources
   - Keep Ollama updated
   - Monitor resource usage

3. **API Token Management**:
   - Use long-lived access tokens with minimal permissions
   - Store tokens securely (environment variables, not in code)
   - Rotate tokens regularly
   - Monitor token usage

### For Developers

1. **Secure Development**:
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Use type hints and validation
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Regular security testing

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use security scanning tools
   - Audit dependencies regularly
   - Use pinned versions in production

3. **Testing**:
   - Include security tests in test suite
   - Test error conditions and edge cases
   - Validate all inputs and outputs
   - Test with malicious inputs

## Security Tools

### Automated Security Checks

- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated security checks
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Dependency vulnerability alerts

### Manual Security Review

- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed for security issues
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing
- **Dependency Audit**: Regular dependency security audit
- **Configuration Review**: Security configuration review

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection**: Monitor for security incidents
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Improve security posture

### Communication

- **Internal**: Notify development team immediately
- **Users**: Communicate through GitHub releases and documentation
- **Public**: Coordinate disclosure with security researchers

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Patch Releases**: For critical security fixes (e.g., 1.0.1)
- **Minor Releases**: For important security improvements (e.g., 1.1.0)
- **Major Releases**: For significant security changes (e.g., 2.0.0)

## Contact Information

- **Security Email**: `security@example.com`
- **General Issues**: GitHub Issues
- **Discussions**: GitHub Discussions
